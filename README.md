The theme of our project is a <b>web service for creating block diagrams of code in the C language.</b>


The project is created <i>collectively</i>: we look at each other's code, supplement it and refactor it, reconcile the changes and commit the changes to this repository.

The project consists of a parser, a visual part (dynamically processes the results of the parser from an array of objects). Also in the project there is text processing on RegExp.

<b>Our project is able to display:</b>
1. if/else(dynamic)
2. loops(can be use also with if/else)
3. swith
4. etc...

# USAGE <br>
